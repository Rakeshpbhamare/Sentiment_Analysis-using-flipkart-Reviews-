866,Flipkart Customer,"Was very nice initially . Poor battery life Battery dead after 6 months of functioning. and product not powering up after that.Since it was during warranty period , I emailed the customer care  . They replied with list of repair service provider. But the numbers are inactivated.Appear like warranty promises are fraud. Don't recommend to buy because poor battery life expectancy and bad warranty promises Better buy some thing with lithium polymer battery than lithium ironREAD MORE",

869,Flipkart Customer,The product screen size is good specially for those who wrist size is less it looks good.. I am using it from 2 days battery back up is also good.. If we use the application regularly then only battery gets little drain. And friends I have uploaded the photo while charging the display does not shows that it is fully charged.. So do not assume that charging is still left to get full 100% always check your app.. In Da Fit app the charging percentage it showsREAD MORE,4
